    "text": "Each February, in Punxsutawney Pennsylvania, Phil the groundhog decides the fate of warm-weather loving athletes across America. If Phil emerges from his hole and sees his shadow, legend says that there will be six more weeks of winter.\nFor Phil’s fans in Philadelphia’s cycling community, the real question isn’t whether the groundhog sees his shadow — it’s how long until the bike can come out of storage.\nI analyzed 20 years of Philadelphia weather data to answer the question every winter-weary cyclist asks: when can I finally ride without freezing?\nThe answer? It depends on the year — and Phil’s timeframe isn’t a reliable range to hope for spring.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\nweather_df = pd.read_csv('data/philadelphia_weather_2005_to_2025.csv')\nweather_df = weather_df.assign(date=pd.to_datetime(weather_df['date']))\n\n\n#make a graph that has year on the x axis, and number of days before the weather improves\n#make a new column with a value for whether the weather is &gt; 65 degrees\n#want to change this so that days = number of days after gh day until high temp = 65\n\nghday = pd.to_datetime( #makes a datetime object\n    dict( #for every row the dataset, it'll give the second of feb \n        year=weather_df[\"date\"].dt.year,\n        month=2,\n        day=2))\n\n#all days after Groundhog Day where high &gt; 70\n#example approach\n#winter_filter = (weather_df['date']&gt;=ghday) & (weather_df['date']&lt;=winter_end) #looks at dates between gh and 6 weeks after\nwarm_days = weather_df[(weather_df['date'] &gt;= ghday) & (weather_df['high'] &gt; 70)]\n    #filters by days after groundhog day, AND where tempertature is greater than 70 degrees\n\n#first warm day for each year\nfirst_warm_day = warm_days.groupby('year')['date'].min()\n\n#make a dataset that includes the year and the number of days since ghday it took to get to the warmest day\nghday_by_yr = pd.to_datetime(dict(year=first_warm_day.index, month=2, day=2)) #I had to look up how to change the code you gave us w the index\nghday_by_yr.index = first_warm_day.index  # match the index (also had to look this up)\n\n#finding the number of days it took for the weather to get better\ndays = (first_warm_day - ghday_by_yr).dt.days\n\ndays.mean()\n\nnp.float64(43.23809523809524)\n\n\n\ndays[days == days.min()]\n\nyear\n2018    18\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\ndays[days == days.max()]\n\nyear\n2014    68\ndtype: int64\n\n\nOn average, Philadelphians wait about 43 days after Groundhog Day for the first 75°F high (the perfect cycling weather). But the range is brutal. In 2018, lucky cyclists hit the roads within 18 days. But just four years later, there was a punishing 68 days of waiting, well past when Phil promised spring would arrive.\n\ndays.plot(kind='bar')\n#days.plot(kind='line', style='-o')\nplt.ylabel('Days until first day above 70°F')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.title('Days from Groundhog Day to First Warm Day')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, there doesn’t seem to be a predictable pattern in the number of days until cyclists can reliably set out for the trail. Although 2015 through 2019 may have given false hope for an early spring, there are a clustering of years after 2010 where wait times for good riding weather were well over 40-50 days.\n\n\nEach year, Phil’s predictions fall within a six-week range, meaning that even if past weather patterns give few clues to hopeful sunbathers and sportspeople, maybe a magic groundhog can.\nThe following graph demonstrates in orange, the number of days where it took less than six weeks for the weather to improve. In 12 out of 20 years, it took over 42 days for the weather to improve. In most other cases, it took much longer.\n\n#if days are greater than 6*7 (42), then turn the bar of the graph red\nfill_colors = ['#99CCFF' if d &gt;= 42 else '#FFB266' for d in days]\n#plot\nax = days.plot(kind='bar')\nfill_colors = ['#99CCFF' if d &gt;= 42 else '#FFB266' for d in days] #days until good cycling weather is &gt; six weeks in orange\nfor patch, color in zip(ax.patches, fill_colors):\n    patch.set_facecolor(color)\nplt.ylabel('Days until first day above 70°F')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.title('Days from Groundhog Day to First Warm Day')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key takeaway is that although on average, it will take six weeks for winter to end, from year to year, outdoor athletes shouldn’t plan their rides or runs around a Phil’s time frame. This variaiton suggess that bike commuters should ignore the groundhog and just buy good gloves."

    "text": "Personality tests can tell us whether people are more likely to do any number of things. People who identify as “thinkers” rather than feelers might be more likely to make pro-con lists for difficult decisions. “Perceivers” might be more likely than “judgers” to go on a spontaneous trip, or try new things. But is it fair to say that certain personality types reliably act in a certain way?\nIn this analysis, I investigate whether extroverts more active on social media.\nIn the Meyers’ Brigs (personality) Type Indicator (MBTI), Introversion (I) and Extroversion (E) define how people direct their energy and interact with the world. I expect that people who are more extroverted will be more likely to interact with others, even online! However the opposite may be true, that introverts prefer online interactions to in person interactions, and are therefore more likely to replace in-person conversations with social media ones.\nUnderstanding the likelihood that different personality types post on social media might tell us which of these hypotheses drive behavior for different kinds of people.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown, display\n    #had to look this up\n\n\nsm = pd.read_csv('data/mbti.csv')\n\nFirst, I discovered how many people posting on social media are extroverts. After all, there’s a possibility that just by nature of being more social, they’re more likely to be incldued in the dataset. To identify this, I counted the number of people who identify as extroverted (“E” in the dataset) compared to the number of people who identify as introverted (“I” in the dataset).\n\n#split the type column into each of the identifiers\nsm['M'] = sm['type'].str[0]\nsm['B'] = sm['type'].str[1]\nsm['T'] = sm['type'].str[2]\nsm['I'] = sm['type'].str[3]\n\n#basic summary statistics for the numbers of each personality trait\nsm['M'].value_counts()\n\nM\nI    6676\nE    1999\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\nintrovert = sm['M'].value_counts().iloc[0]\nextrovert = sm['M'].value_counts().iloc[1]\n\n\nmkdwm_str = f'''\nSurprisingly, the number of introverts in the dataset **({introvert})** is far larger than the number of extroverts **({extrovert})**. \n\nTo see whether this kind of variation in personality traits was spread consistently across the dataset, or whether my sample might be skewed toward a certain personality, I plotted the frequency of different MBTI identifiers.\n'''\ndisplay(Markdown(mkdwm_str))\n\nSurprisingly, the number of introverts in the dataset (6676) is far larger than the number of extroverts (1999).\nTo see whether this kind of variation in personality traits was spread consistently across the dataset, or whether my sample might be skewed toward a certain personality, I plotted the frequency of different MBTI identifiers.\n\n\n\n#making a dataframe so I can plot the whole set of personality traits in the dataset\n    #I didn't realize until later that MBTI just stands for meyers briggs personality types, \n    #but these were still useful identifiers for the labels, which I made in this dictionary\ncounts = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Introversion/Extraversion ': sm['M'].value_counts(),\n    'Sensing/Intuition': sm['B'].value_counts(),\n    'Thinking/Feeling': sm['T'].value_counts(),\n    'Judging/Perceiving': sm['I'].value_counts()\n})\n\n#had to look up how to do this, because the pandas plot from the 03 slides for this week wasn't super customizable\n    #how I understand this is that fig changes the canvas size and ax manages the plot itself\n    #it's the same as saying: \n        # result = plt.subplots()\n        # fig = result[0]  # the figure\n        # ax = result[1]   # the axes\n    #which assigns a figure and axis so I can manage these separately\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))\ncounts.transpose().plot(kind='barh', ax=ax, width=.9) \nax.set_xlabel('Count', fontsize=12)\nax.set_ylabel('Dimension', fontsize=12)\nax.set_title('MBTI Personality Trait Distribution', fontsize=14)\nax.legend(title='Type')\nax.grid(axis='x', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)\nplt.tight_layout() #had to look this up, but I still don't understand why my spacing is so strange\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that much like the introversion/extroversion element of the Meyers Briggs personality type, there is a wide gap between respondents who identify as Intuitive vs. Sensing personality types. There are more similar distributions between the Judging/Perceivng and the Thinking/Feeling categories.\nTherefore, if we assume that our sample is representative of the entire population, the high number of introverts in out data might support the second hypotheses. Because introverts are less predisposed to social interactions, they are more likely to engage online. This may be a replacement of otherwise in-person conversations.\n\n\nAlthough more introverts in the sample supports the second hypothesis, this may also be a quirk of data collection. Perhaps the specific online forum of MBTI personalities is more likely to include introverts for some other systematic reason, unrelated to personality type.\nTo further test my hypotheses, I checked the length of posts for different personality types.\n\nsm['post_length'] = sm['posts'].str.len() #take the length\nsm[1:3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilename\ntype\nposts\nM\nB\nT\nI\npost_length\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\nENTP\n'I'm finding the lack of me in these posts ver...\nE\nN\nT\nP\n7053\n\n\n2\n2\nINTP\n'Good one  _____   https://www.youtube.com/wat...\nI\nN\nT\nP\n5265\n\n\n3\n3\nINTJ\n'Dear INTP,   I enjoyed our conversation the o...\nI\nN\nT\nJ\n6271\n\n\n4\n4\nENTJ\n'You're fired.|||That's another silly misconce...\nE\nN\nT\nJ\n6111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#take the mean of the I and E groups in the M column to see the average post length\nlen_by_ei = sm.groupby('M')['post_length'].mean()\nlen_by_ei\n\nM\nE    7198.235118\nI    7245.995057\nName: post_length, dtype: float64\n\n\n\nlen_by_ei['E'] &gt; len_by_ei['I'] #unclear why I couldn't use 1 and 0 here.
